        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph</p>

        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser 
            ignores it.
        </p>

        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>this some text</p>
        <hr>
        <hr>

        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line break.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored:</p>
        <p>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

            My Bonnie lies over the sea.

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>
        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

            My Bonnie lies over the sea.

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
